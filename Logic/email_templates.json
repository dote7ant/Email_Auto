    "body": "Hi [Apprentice's Name],\n\nI hope you are doing well.  Terry Coach\n\nI am reaching out regarding your engagement with the programme. Our records show that it has been [Number of days] since your last attendance, and you are currently [Number of hours] behind on your Off-the-Job (OTJ) training hours. This places you significantly off track, as both attendance and OTJ logging are key metrics we use to monitor learner engagement.\n\nAs there has been no response to previous messages and no improvement in your engagement, I have copied in [Manager's Name], your apprentice manager, for visibility. We now need to arrange a meeting to discuss how you plan to get back on track. As discussed during the launch meeting, logging OTJ hours on a weekly basis is a mandatory requirement to ensure compliance with government regulations.\n\nYour prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.\n\nYour Coach,"
